We as a group (Furkan, Efe, Utku) try to:

Implement core API functions (StartQuery(), EndQuery(), MatchDocument(), GetNextAvailRes()) and create a test driver to validate them using sample data files.

Optimize the initial implementation for higher throughput using techniques like multithreading, caching, and data structures.

Develop a data-parallel version using a framework like Apache Spark, Flink, or Dask, and compare its performance with previous implementations.

Deliverables include the source code, test results, and reports detailing implementation, optimizations, and performance comparisons.

## Contents

Included are files and directories:

- README: This document
- Makefile: Makefile to compile
- include/: Header files
- implementation/: Cpp files
- old_implementations/: Contains our attempts and old implementations
- test_driver/: Contains the test driver implementation. (Not used)
- python/: Contains our python implementations
- python/test.py: Contains our translated test driver in python
- test_data/: Contatins the test data
- results/: Created after running the benchmark, with each implementations' runtime
- result.txt: Created after running the benchmark, with reference solution's runtime
- benchmark.py: Main python file to run the test

## Minimum Requirements

GCC/G++ (Version supporting C++17)

Python 3 (Installed and accessible as python3)

Pip (For dependency installation)

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation, follow these steps:

```bash
make
```

Then, setup the python environment for the required libraries:

```bash
make setup_python
```

Make sure to update your python interpreter to the .venv path in your workspace:
".../AWT-2024-2025/.venv/bin/python"

For Visual Studio Code:

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`(Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P`(Mac) to open the command palette.
Search for "Python: Select Interpreter" and click on "Enter interpreter path...". And enter .venv path.

Close and Reopen Visual Studio Code if necessary

Start the speed test using:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

This will run the given reference solution and all of our implementations, then plot their throughputs as bar and point graphs.

To clean the virtual environment and compiled c files:

```bash
make clean
```
